## ❓ About <a name = "about"></a>
Training Hub is an app designed to help personal trainers (PTs) manage their clients, track workouts and progress, monitor client status, and communicate with them. Clients will have a mobile app to follow workouts, mark them as done, give feedback, and communicate with their PTs. 

The app is inspired by the challenges faced by PTs like my sister, who struggled to find an affordable and comprehensive tool that integrates several functionalities such as Excel, WhatsApp, and notepads—all in one place.
